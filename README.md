Description

The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) contains 7356 files (total size: 24.8 GB). The database contains 24 professional actors (12 female, 12 male), vocalizing two lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent. Speech includes calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, surprise, and disgust expressions, and song contains calm, happy, sad, angry, and fearful emotions. Each expression is produced at two levels of emotional intensity (normal, strong), with an additional neutral expression. All conditions are available in three modality formats: Audio-only (16bit, 48kHz .wav), Audio-Video (720p H.264, AAC 48kHz, .mp4), and Video-only (no sound).  Note, there are no song files for Actor_18.

## Audio-only files

Audio-only files of all actors (01-24) are available as two separate zip files (~200 MB each):

Speech file (Audio_Speech_Actors_01-24.zip, 215 MB) contains 1440 files: 60 trials per actor x 24 actors = 1440.
